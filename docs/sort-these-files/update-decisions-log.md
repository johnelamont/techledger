### ADR-001: Visual Configuration Documentation via Screenshot-to-Structured-Data Pipeline
**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Decision:** Support documentation of visual-only system configurations (workflows, automations) through screenshot-to-structured-data pipeline using AI parsing.  
**Context:** Many business systems store critical logic in UI-only configurations without programmatic export. Need to document these systems.  
**Impact:** Enables documentation of previously undocumentable systems; adds new importer plugin architecture.  
**File:** `decisions/adr-001-visual-configuration-documentation.md`
