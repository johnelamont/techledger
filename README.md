## About This Manifest

This manifest is a living document that tracks all aspects of the techledger project. It is designed to be used iteratively with Claude.ai to manage project complexity over time.

## Structure

```
/strategy           - Vision, mission, objectives, and success metrics
/product           - Requirements, features, user flows, and terminology
/technical         - Architecture, tech stack, data models, and APIs
/operations        - Deployment, testing, and security

## How to Use This Manifest

### With Claude.ai
